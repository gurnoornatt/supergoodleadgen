## Architecture Overview
- **lead_processor.py**: Core lead processing engine with all analysis methods
- **gym_software_database.py**: Gym software detection patterns and metadata
- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive tests for each component (60 tests passing)

## Key Components Implemented
1. **Gym Category Detection**: Identifies gym types (fitness, yoga, martial arts, etc.)
2. **Software Detection**: Identifies 20+ gym management platforms
3. **Website Feature Analysis**: Analyzes 10 key website features
4. **Mobile App Detection**: Detects gym-specific mobile apps
5. **Digital Infrastructure Scoring**: Comprehensive scoring with tier classification
6. **Gym Pain Factors Analysis**: Categorizes pain points into 5 areas:
   - Operational Inefficiencies (25% weight)
   - Member Retention Risks (30% weight)
   - Competitive Disadvantages (20% weight)
   - Revenue Loss Factors (15% weight)
   - Growth Limitations (10% weight)
7. **Gym Size & Model-Specific Scoring**: Adjusts pain scores based on:
   - Gym size multipliers (Large: 1.2x, Medium: 1.0x, Small: 0.8x)
   - Business model multipliers (Boutique: 1.3x, CrossFit: 1.2x, Personal Training: 0.7x, etc.)
   - Critical threshold violations based on gym size
   - Size and model-specific pain factors
8. **Gym-Specific RED/GREEN Classification**: Multi-criteria classification system:
   - Considers adjusted pain scores, urgency levels, digital infrastructure
   - Size and model-specific criteria (e.g., large gyms need mobile apps)
   - Confidence levels (low/medium/high/very_high) based on criteria strength
   - Sales readiness indicators (hot_lead/warm_lead/not_ready)
   - Action priority levels (urgent/medium/low)
   - Comprehensive classification summaries for sales teams
9. **Revenue Qualification System**: Comprehensive lead viability assessment:
   - Member count estimation with gym type multipliers
   - Monthly revenue estimation based on pricing indicators
   - Viability scoring (0-100) with multiple components
   - Software budget estimation (2-3.5% of revenue)
   - Qualification tiers (unqualified to highly_qualified)
10. **Decision Maker Identification**: Sales intelligence system:
   - Decision structure analysis (corporate/owner-operated/owner-direct)
   - Owner detection from review mentions
   - Contact quality assessment
   - Management hierarchy mapping
   - Sales approach recommendations with cycle estimates
   - Franchise-specific considerations
11. **Budget Estimation System**: Advanced software budget modeling:
   - Type-specific base percentages (1.5-3.5% of revenue)
   - Digital maturity adjustments (±20-30%)
   - Current software situation analysis
   - Detailed budget breakdown by component
   - Package and pricing tier recommendations
   - Contract negotiation guidance
   - ROI projections with payback period
   - Competitor spend estimates
