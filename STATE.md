2. ✅ Task 2: Gym Management Software Detection System
3. ✅ Task 3: Gym Website and App Analysis
   - ✅ Subtask 3.1: Implement gym website feature analysis
   - ✅ Subtask 3.2: Create mobile app detection system
   - ✅ Subtask 3.3: Develop digital infrastructure scoring
4. ✅ Task 4: Gym-Specific Pain Scoring Algorithm (COMPLETED)
   - ✅ Subtask 4.1: Define gym-specific pain factors
   - ✅ Subtask 4.2: Create gym size and model-specific scoring
   - ✅ Subtask 4.3: Implement gym-specific RED/GREEN classification

## Architecture Overview
- **lead_processor.py**: Core lead processing engine with all analysis methods
- **gym_software_database.py**: Gym software detection patterns and metadata
- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive tests for each component (60 tests passing)

## Key Components Implemented
1. **Gym Category Detection**: Identifies gym types (fitness, yoga, martial arts, etc.)
2. **Software Detection**: Identifies 20+ gym management platforms
3. **Website Feature Analysis**: Analyzes 10 key website features
4. **Mobile App Detection**: Detects gym-specific mobile apps
5. **Digital Infrastructure Scoring**: Comprehensive scoring with tier classification
6. **Gym Pain Factors Analysis**: Categorizes pain points into 5 areas:
   - Operational Inefficiencies (25% weight)
   - Member Retention Risks (30% weight)
   - Competitive Disadvantages (20% weight)
   - Revenue Loss Factors (15% weight)
   - Growth Limitations (10% weight)
7. **Gym Size & Model-Specific Scoring**: Adjusts pain scores based on:
   - Gym size multipliers (Large: 1.2x, Medium: 1.0x, Small: 0.8x)
   - Business model multipliers (Boutique: 1.3x, CrossFit: 1.2x, Personal Training: 0.7x, etc.)
   - Critical threshold violations based on gym size
   - Size and model-specific pain factors
8. **Gym-Specific RED/GREEN Classification**: Multi-criteria classification system:
   - Considers adjusted pain scores, urgency levels, digital infrastructure
   - Size and model-specific criteria (e.g., large gyms need mobile apps)
   - Confidence levels (low/medium/high/very_high) based on criteria strength
   - Sales readiness indicators (hot_lead/warm_lead/not_ready)
   - Action priority levels (urgent/medium/low)
   - Comprehensive classification summaries for sales teams

## Next Steps
### Task 5: Google Slides Template Design
- Design professional Pain-Gap Audit template
- Create placeholder system for data injection
- Design visual layout and branding

## Technical Notes
- All implementations follow TDD with comprehensive test coverage
- Integration with existing lead_processor.py pipeline maintained
- Scoring uses 0-100 scale consistently
- Error handling and logging throughout

## Testing Standards
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for pipeline flow
- Edge case coverage
- Performance validation
- All tests must pass before marking subtask complete
