# Task ID: 5
# Title: Lead Scoring and Classification
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement pain scoring logic to classify leads as 'RED' or 'GREEN' based on performance and technology criteria.
# Details:
Apply pain scoring algorithm. Tag leads as 'RED' if mobile speed score < 60/100. Add 'Status' column to lead list. Combine PageSpeed and BuiltWith data for comprehensive scoring. Consider technology age in scoring logic. Create scoring dashboard for analysis.

# Test Strategy:
Test scoring logic with sample data, verify correct classification of leads. Test edge cases and boundary conditions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Apply pain scoring algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core pain scoring logic based on performance and technology criteria
### Details:
Create scoring algorithm, define scoring weights, implement calculation logic

## 2. Tag leads as 'RED' or 'GREEN' based on mobile speed score [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Classify leads based on mobile performance score threshold (< 60/100 = RED)
### Details:
Implement classification logic, apply threshold rules, tag leads appropriately

## 3. Add 'Status' column to lead list [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create Status column in output data to track lead classification
### Details:
Add Status field to data structure, populate with RED/GREEN values, update output format

## 4. Combine PageSpeed and BuiltWith data for comprehensive scoring [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate performance and technology data for holistic lead scoring
### Details:
Merge data from both APIs, create unified scoring model, balance performance vs technology factors

## 5. Consider technology age in scoring logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Factor in technology age and obsolescence in the scoring algorithm
### Details:
Weight older technologies higher in pain scoring, identify technology debt indicators

## 6. Create scoring dashboard for analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build dashboard to visualize and analyze lead scoring results
### Details:
Create scoring analytics interface, display RED vs GREEN distribution, show scoring breakdowns
