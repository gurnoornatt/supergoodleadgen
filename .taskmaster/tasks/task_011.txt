# Task ID: 11
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the system to process at least 200 leads per day and generate 50+ 'RED' audits.
# Details:
Implement batch processing for API calls. Optimize database queries and data handling. Implement caching where appropriate. Monitor and optimize performance bottlenecks. Ensure cost per 'RED' lead stays under $0.50. Implement parallel processing where possible.

# Test Strategy:
Load test with 200+ leads, verify performance targets are met and costs are within budget. Monitor resource usage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement batch processing for API calls [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize API calls by processing leads in batches
### Details:
Group API calls into batches, implement batch processing logic, optimize API usage

## 2. Optimize database queries and data handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Improve data processing efficiency and reduce bottlenecks
### Details:
Optimize data queries, implement efficient data structures, reduce memory usage

## 3. Implement caching where appropriate [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add caching mechanisms to reduce redundant API calls and improve performance
### Details:
Cache API responses, implement cache invalidation, optimize cache hit rates

## 4. Monitor and optimize performance bottlenecks [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks in the system
### Details:
Profile system performance, identify slow components, implement optimizations

## 5. Ensure cost per 'RED' lead stays under $0.50 [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Monitor and optimize costs to meet budget requirements
### Details:
Track API costs, optimize usage, implement cost controls, monitor cost per lead

## 6. Implement parallel processing where possible [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add parallel processing to improve throughput and reduce processing time
### Details:
Implement concurrent API calls, parallel data processing, optimize for multi-core systems
