# Task ID: 12
# Title: Error Handling and Reliability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the system.
# Details:
Add error handling for failed API calls, missing websites, broken URLs. Implement exponential backoff for rate limits. Create comprehensive logging system. Add 'Error Notes' column to track issues. Ensure system doesn't crash on errors. Implement alerting for critical failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test with intentionally broken data, verify error handling works and system remains stable. Test recovery procedures.
