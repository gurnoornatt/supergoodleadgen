# Gym Management Software Lead Generation System
## Project Name: Gym Software Pain-Gap Audit Automation
### Version: 1.0
### Date: January 27, 2025
### Status: Ready for Development

## 1. Overview & Business Goal
This document outlines the requirements for retrofitting the existing Pain-Gap Audit automation system to identify and qualify gym and fitness business leads for gym management software sales. The primary business goal is to generate high-volume lists of qualified gym leads with poor digital infrastructure, creating personalized "Gym Software Pain-Gap Audits" at scale.

## 2. Target User & Persona
- **Primary User**: Gym Management Software Sales Team
- **Secondary User**: Virtual Assistant (VA) for follow-up calls
- **Target Market**: Gym owners and managers with poor digital infrastructure

## 3. Functional Requirements (User Stories)

### EPIC 1: Gym-Specific Lead Ingestion & Scraping
**User Story 1.1**: As the sales team, I want to scrape Google Maps for gym and fitness businesses across target cities.
**User Story 1.2**: As the sales team, I want to extract gym-specific data including class schedules, membership info, and trainer listings.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Scrape gym categories: "gym", "fitness center", "health club", "personal training", "crossfit", "yoga studio", "pilates studio", "boxing gym", "martial arts school", "dance studio", "swimming pool"
- Extract: Business Name, Website URL, Phone Number, Google Business Profile Link, Physical Address, Gym Size Indicators, Services Offered
- Output to CSV/Google Sheets format

### EPIC 2: Gym Digital Portfolio Analysis
**User Story 2.1**: As the sales team, I want to analyze each gym's website for existing management software platforms.
**User Story 2.2**: As the sales team, I want to detect booking systems, member portals, and payment processing capabilities.
**User Story 2.3**: As the sales team, I want to analyze mobile app presence and quality.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Detect existing gym management platforms (MindBody, Zen Planner, Wodify, TeamUp, etc.)
- Identify booking system presence and sophistication
- Analyze member portal functionality
- Check mobile app availability (iOS/Android) and quality
- Assess payment processing integration

### EPIC 3: Gym-Specific Pain Scoring
**User Story 3.1**: As the sales team, I want to score gyms based on their digital infrastructure gaps.
**User Story 3.2**: As the sales team, I want to identify gyms most likely to need management software upgrades.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Score based on management software gaps (40% weight)
- Score based on mobile app quality (30% weight)
- Score based on website performance (20% weight)
- Score based on booking system sophistication (10% weight)
- Tag leads as "RED" if pain score indicates high upgrade likelihood

### EPIC 4: Gym Software Audit Generation
**User Story 4.1**: For every "RED" gym lead, I want to automatically generate a gym-specific PDF audit.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Take full-page screenshot of gym's current website
- Extract gym logo or generate fallback
- Create gym-specific pain points analysis
- Include gym management software ROI calculations
- Generate personalized gym software recommendations

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Process 200+ gym leads per day to generate 50+ "RED" audits
- **Cost**: Keep cost per "RED" lead under $0.50
- **Reliability**: Handle API failures, missing websites, and broken URLs gracefully
- **Usability**: Clean output format for VA follow-up calls

## 5. Technical Stack & Implementation Plan
- **Scraping**: SerpApi Google Maps Organic Results (existing)
- **Website Analysis**: PageSpeed Insights API, BuiltWith API (existing)
- **Gym Software Detection**: Enhanced BuiltWith analysis + custom detection logic
- **Mobile App Analysis**: App Store API integration for iOS/Android app detection

  - Mobile App Present (Yes/No)
  - Payment Processing Integration (Yes/No)
  - Class Schedule Management (Yes/No)
  - Trainer Management System (Yes/No)
  - Member Check-in System (Yes/No)

### Gym Pain Scoring Algorithm
- **Management Software Gaps (40%)**: No software = 100 pain, outdated software = 60-80 pain
- **Mobile App Quality (30%)**: No app = 100 pain, poor app = 60-80 pain
- **Website Performance (20%)**: Mobile score < 60 = 100 pain
- **Booking System (10%)**: No online booking = 100 pain, basic booking = 50 pain

## 7. Gym Software Detection Strategy
