		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Setup AI Sales Intelligence Agent Environment",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down environment setup into: dependency installation and requirements.txt creation, environment configuration (.env, .gitignore), Playwright browser installation and verification, and project structure organization to separate AI agent from existing audit tools.",
			"reasoning": "Environment setup is moderately complex due to multiple dependencies (LangChain, Groq, Playwright) and configuration requirements, but follows standard Python project patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Configuration Manager and CLI Arguments",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: configuration class implementation for environment variable and .env file handling, CLI argument parsing with argparse for input/output parameters, and input validation with error handling for missing keys and invalid CSV structure.",
			"reasoning": "Configuration management is a common pattern with well-established libraries (argparse, dotenv), making it straightforward to implement with proper validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Build Data I/O and State Management System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: CSV reading and validation logic for required columns, chunking system implementation for 200-row batches, resumption logic using website_url comparison between input and output files, and output CSV structure definition with proper column mapping.",
			"reasoning": "Data management with resumption logic adds complexity due to state tracking and comparison algorithms, plus the need for robust file I/O handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Playwright Web Content Renderer",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: async Playwright browser setup and context management, worker pool implementation for parallel processing, resource blocking configuration (images, CSS) for performance, timeout and error handling for various failure scenarios, and HTML content extraction with proper cleanup.",
			"reasoning": "Async browser automation with parallel processing and resource optimization requires careful handling of browser lifecycle, error conditions, and performance considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Create LangChain AI Agent Orchestrator",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: LangChain client setup for Groq API with meta-llama model configuration, Analysis Agent implementation with exact prompt specification and JSON schema validation, batch processing system using abatch() method for API efficiency, and response parsing with error handling for malformed JSON.",
			"reasoning": "AI agent integration with specific model requirements, exact prompt formatting, and batch API calls adds significant complexity due to external API dependencies and JSON schema compliance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Email Generation Agent",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: Email Agent LangChain implementation with exact prompt specification, integration with batched Groq API calls for efficiency, and email validation for word count limits and call-to-action requirements.",
			"reasoning": "Email generation is moderately complex due to specific formatting requirements (150 words, personalization) and integration with the existing AI pipeline."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Build Comprehensive Error Handling and Retry System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: error classification system for different failure types (non-recoverable, recoverable, validation), exponential backoff retry logic with configurable attempts, exception handling integration throughout the pipeline, and graceful degradation for individual lead failures while maintaining batch processing.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive error handling with different retry strategies and classifications requires sophisticated logic to handle various failure scenarios while maintaining system resilience."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 23,
			"taskTitle": "Create Observability and Logging System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: structured JSON logging system with timestamps and lead tracking, tqdm progress bar implementation with detailed statistics, final summary report generation with success/failure counts, and real-time status logging for batch and API operations.",
			"reasoning": "Logging and monitoring systems require structured design for JSON formatting, progress tracking, and user feedback, but follow established patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 24,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Main Processing Pipeline Integration",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: main() function structure and component coordination, async/await handling for Playwright operations, configuration loading and validation integration, chunked processing workflow with state management, clean shutdown and resource cleanup implementation, and resumption detection and startup logic.",
			"reasoning": "Pipeline integration is highly complex as it orchestrates all components, handles async operations, manages state across interruptions, and ensures proper resource cleanup."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 25,
			"taskTitle": "Create Documentation and Performance Optimization",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: comprehensive README.md creation with setup instructions and troubleshooting, performance optimization for 20-second processing target through parallel workers and batching, performance monitoring and bottleneck identification implementation, and security documentation for .env and .gitignore practices.",
			"reasoning": "Documentation and optimization requires thorough testing, performance measurement, and clear technical writing, plus specific performance targets that may require iterative tuning."
