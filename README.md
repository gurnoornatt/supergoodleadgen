## 🎯 Project Overview

RedFlag addresses a critical gap in the Central Valley market: **independent businesses lacking modern digital infrastructure**. Our analysis reveals that 100% of independent gyms in major cities like Bakersfield and Fresno operate without professional websites, representing a $2M+ annual opportunity.

### Key Capabilities

- **Automated Lead Discovery**: Google Maps scraping via SerpAPI with intelligent chain filtering
- **Digital Infrastructure Assessment**: PageSpeed Insights integration for performance scoring  
- **Technology Stack Analysis**: BuiltWith API for comprehensive tech profiling
- **Pain-Gap Scoring**: Proprietary algorithm for lead qualification and prioritization
- **Asset Generation**: Automated screenshot capture and logo extraction/generation
- **Report Automation**: Integration with Make.com for PDF audit generation at scale

### Business Impact

- **200+ leads processed daily** across multiple Central Valley markets
- **50+ qualified RED audits generated** per day with automated follow-up
- **Cost per qualified lead: <$0.50** through optimized API usage
- **Market Coverage**: Bakersfield, Fresno, Modesto, Stockton, and expanding
